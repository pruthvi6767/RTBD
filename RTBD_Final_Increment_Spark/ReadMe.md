This is our class project in Real Time Big Data. Our robot is CoBoRo, a personal cooking assistant where it will identify images of either vegetables or fruits sent from a client device and give suitable recipes or even narrate based on user's input. Not only that it is an interactive robot where it can give user's recipes based on weather also. We have programmed our application for the WowWee Robot.

For our backend we used Apache Spark.

We have used the logistic regression machine learning algorithm to predict images that the user sends to the robot.

To use your own dataset of images you just need to copy the images to the files folder each with its respective class name.
